# PostAPI-Testdata
TestREPO for PostAPI pictures and videos
This is just a test, because instagram graph api requires a URL to a picture that really exists in the internet.
I am trying to upload it to this Repo into the main branch and then give the Graph API the URL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPO/.../pic.jpg"
IF this test works i am going to create a separate account for this Storage repo because i dont want to spam my profile with activity that i caused by my script.
