# PostAPI-Testdata
TestREPO for PostAPI pictures and videos
This is just a test, because instagram graph api requires a URL to a picture that really exists in the internet.
I am trying to upload it to this Repo into the main branch and then give the Graph API the URL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPO/.../pic.jpg"
IF this test works i am going to create a separate account for this Storage repo because i dont want to spam my profile with activity that i caused by my script.

# UPDATE
Okay so this test worked with my test instagram profile and I already created a seperate github account for this purpose. I will create a Repo with this account and add myself as contributor.
The User is called PostAPI-STRG (Postapi-Storage) and the Repo is called "PostAPI-Storage" (this name could change in some time). Heres a Link: "https://github.com/PostAPI-STRG/PostAPI-Storage".
I won't delete this Repo because of information purposes but if i delete it then there will be an entry on the PostAPI Webpage, which is also a repo in github working with github pages.
